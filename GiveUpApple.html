            <p name="a828" id="a828" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most computers we use, be it phones, notebooks
              or desktops are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_hardware"
                data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_hardware" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
                rel="noopener" target="_blank">proprietary</a>. That means the people/companies who developed them have
              released only the product in the market for users to use and operate but are hesitant in giving out the
              specifications, datasheets and design documentation. They say that it is confidential and intellectual
              property of the company/individual. Building a computer is not rocket science. Every individual can build
              one for their personal use. All it takes is some enthusiasm and willingness to explore beyond the obvious.
            </p>
            <p name="2ddf" id="2ddf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, if one were to buy a computer from Apple
              (say a MacBook Air) then, one has to use what Apple provides. There are few or no alternatives to spare
              components, firmware or software. It is usually termed as a ‘jail’ wherein one is forced to follow the
              rules formulated by Apple developers. Tweaking or breaking any code be it hardware or software can
              potentially void the warranty and if one chooses to be magnanimous and shares it on internet then, one is
              bound to face legal action (depending on how much impact it creates). One has no idea what components were
              rigged on to the motherboard. If they fail (most often they do) then, the only option is to replace the
              complete motherboard with every component on it. Guess what? The cost of doing this can fetch you a new
              computer with similar config! The business model here (I’m guessing) is to build computers that could last
              for say a couple of years (or three years maximum, remember they sell you an extended warranty which burns
              a hole in the pocket!). Then, components fail and users are forced to buy new one. A classic example of
              promoting ‘use and throw’. No reuse or repair. If users had access to the specifications, BIOS firmware
              code, design of an Apple computer then, it would have been a much easier process to repair and reuse.
              Users would realize that the design of the components are not adhering to any de-facto or de-jure
              standards. All the glitter on the external vanishes when the Mac fails to power on and suddenly one
              realizes that Apple had sold them an illusion and not a computer.</p>
            <p name="c5d5" id="c5d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, now the question is if we are not going to
              buy a computer from Apple or any other proprietary vendor (there are a lot of them but I won’t name them
              as it is an exercise in vanity) then, whom are we going to buy one from? Are we going to build ourselves
              one through elaborate research, procurement and assembly? Or choose a vendor who follows open processes
              and design which are available for study and inspection freely. There are few such groups or companies
              which do this with a motive to liberate the computing for humanity. They allow the user to control every
              component and firmware code in the hardware to operating system kernel and applications. Basically, you
              know in totality what your computer does and just does what you want it to and nothing less or more. A few
              of them such as <a href="https://libreboot.org/suppliers.html#ministry-of-freedom-minifree"

              are open and more freedom respecting. If one were looking for an alternative to the ‘i’ products then
              perhaps they should consider the above ones, before getting swayed by the massive advertising (such
              as — you either have an iPhone or you don’t!) and peer pressure.</p>

            <p name="7a54" id="7a54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Most processors (by Intel and AMD) come
              with Management Engines which are potential <a href="https://libreboot.org/faq.html#intelme"

                rel="noopener" target="_blank">back doors</a> to your computers. All it takes is to trigger a remote
              command from someone sitting at Intel or AMD to shut off your computer or inject malware into your system
              at a much more deeper level (much before you could boot an operating system or technically speaking — much
              before the BIOS could start). Libreboot and others make sure that the computers they sell are free from
              such hardware back doors. They also use free and open source operating system, BIOS (called Core boot and
              its fork the Libreboot) and applications in them. This allows anyone to inspect, validate, change and
              share the machine completely (both hardware and software).</p>

            <p name="02a4" id="02a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">One might argue with a
              different analogy here. Let’s take the example of your favorite dish served at a restaurant. The chef and
              the restaurant management might say that the recipe is their trade secret and intellectual property.
              Giving it out means that there would be lesser foodies at their restaurant. Other restaurants might use it
              to bring up more competition. One chef or restaurant owner may also try to sue a person in court for
              having replicated the dish on their own. Well all of these are churlish, myopic and quick-on-the-buck
              strategies for hubris engulfed narcissists. What they are missing here is when they share the recipe, they
              are also sharing knowledge (Remember — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sharing is caring</em>). To use
              that recipe to have the exact same taste and aroma is more of an art mastered by someone over years of
              practice. The recipe isn’t the only <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">raison d’etre</em> for a
              restaurant. Or its success or failure. It involves a lot of other factors such as pricing, service, hours
              of operation, delivery etc. Now, coming back to computer manufacturers, there are a lot of factors which
              affect their existence in market as well, much similar to a restaurant. In fact, one of the positives in
              making programs and hardware open is this that they are bound to attract more enthusiasts, developers and
              hobbyists who can contribute and promote these computers. Every user of the computer would now know how it
              <i>actually</i> works, repair them at their own convenience, add and remove hardware and software components, and
              in essence use it “just the way they like”. These computers would no longer be termed as ‘jails’ but
              instead ‘gateways’ for vibrant possibilities.</p>
