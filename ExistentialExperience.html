            <p name="ecb4" id="ecb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are only so many things to be envious
              about. Countable. The existence for one is a malady when the perception is defected. It’s so hard to cope
              with rejection isn’t it? As if the entirety of life depended on it. Aloneness, is so dreaded that even the
              spell checker is underlining it in red!</p>
            <p name="ae22" id="ae22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are constantly overwhelmed by our
              surroundings with beings. Happiness is overrated. So is optimism. We’re continuously being conditioned.
              Conditioning with idealistic propaganda and narcissism. The imagery of our being is so profound that
              subtleties of reality are often overshadowed. The human perception is often hazy. The eagerness to discern
              and categorize thoughts and experiences is habitual exercise of the mind. A constant repetitive phenomenon
              with no scope for newness.</p>
            <p name="f6a5" id="f6a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s true that we are living in the past. Our
              memories are deeply rooted and are the reasons for determining the present action. Evolutionary memory
              takes care of the survival. Every human cell is memory in its own way. Replication and cessation are
              innate in them. It takes effort to allow the memory to be ignored. Ignoring memory allows for the
              possibility to see the new. If the memory fails in classifying it, then it is a new occurrence. Every
              little change is a new occurrence. The leaves on the branch of a tree that was there a day ago may not be,
              an unseen bird starts cooing, which wasn't there before. These are barely noticed and perhaps never seen
              as a change or a new occurrence in existence. We are confined by our limitations of sensory perception. We
              can’t feel the change that the planet we live on completed a rotation about its axis in a day or the cells
              in our body have died and replicated in the past hour. Every moment is new and it’s slightly different
              from the previous. Therefore, change happens.</p>
            <p name="0d2a" id="0d2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our mind is something that differentiates us
              from other organisms on this planet. Consciousness is considered as a product of mind. What makes us
              conscious is our ability to think. Thoughts which carry memory of the past and imagery of future
              expectations. One lives in a world of thoughts. Does thought have a physical existence? as it does shape
              the way we act. It flows just like a stream of water. Although, we can’t touch it, we still can experience
              it. Memory would be like a sea formed with these streams of thoughts.</p>

            <p name="45c6" id="45c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Sometimes, thought and
              emotion dictates the way we are. It may be more than just ‘sometimes’. Our way of sensing the environment,
              beings and events has been a function of its pleasantness. As we continue to drag ourselves through this
              endless saga of succumbing to fantasies (a product of thought and memory) and the lust of senses, we find
              hopelessness, desperation and misery. Our aim would have been to seek maximum pleasure out of life and
              satiate our every materialistic craving but there were very few occasions when we have truly risen above
              all these, immaculately. Certain things may be guaranteed, no matter what, as they are existential and
              real. Inaction has no impact on them. The craving of human is certainly an instrument of bondage and
              appeasement. Never a penchant for freedom. Isn’t it strange that we all carry these feelings, emotions,
              desires and deep rooted notions all along and even let them perpetuate endlessly. The fact that we may
              remain unfulfilled happens to be a certain outcome with an outrageously high probability. Thus, only the
              truth can set us free.</p>
