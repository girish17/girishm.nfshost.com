              reminiscing about the place my friend talked of the other day. This café in a tech park where one would
              relish working remotely. Most importantly, it was close to where I stay and beats the suffering from
              traffic. So, I got dressed up, packed my bag with laptop, charger, headphone, USB cable (to charge my
              phone’s battery if it dies) and a bottle of potable water. My mother was generous enough to cook me a
              delicious breakfast with Idli and Saambar (one that only mothers know how to make). After relishing
              this stable and filling food, I take out my car to head for this place in the hope of getting some work
              done.</p>

            <p name="5a43" id="5a43" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After a fifteen-minute drive through the
              dilapidated roads and frenzy, I reached the gates to be greeted by the security guard who asked me for my ID
              card. When I showed my driving license, I realized that he was asking for something different. Lowered my
              window glass and said that I had to go to a café inside (recollecting from my friend’s experience). For
              which he agreed and let me pass. Parked my car in the visitor parking area and started climbing a hill to
              reach the top where the café was located. To give you some perspective — this café is located in a tech
              park which is built on an encroached lake. The lake is non-existent; however, the depths of it are still
              felt. Finally, after a bit of physical exercise, I reach this café with its neon lights reflecting on the
              glass panes of the building. Took a while to settle in as there were no power plug points to charge my
              laptop. After finding one, I started checking my mail as usual only to realize that the internet bandwidth
              on my phone was snail paced. I could probably go to the loo and come back by the time the webpage could
              load. All this effort is in vain. Without the network, there was no way I could work. Saddened, I reached out of the
              building to get some fresh air only to be struck by the sight of a food truck serving Chicken Biryani. I
              said to myself, “At least, you could eat something you liked and head back home.” I checked the time on my
              phone to realize that it was barely noon. I somehow had to stall for some time to get the next quota of
              meal that my body 'deserves.'</p>
            <p name="beab" id="beab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now, instead of getting work done at the
              café, I had to pass time for lunch.
              How productive of me!
              I started looking at people nearby, walking
              from the cafeteria to their offices—all dressed in formal attire to impress their bosses and clients.
              Most of them seemed obese and in their mid-twenties or thirties.
              Obesity is an outcome of their
              sedentary lifestyle.
              I wondered if I were one among them what horrors I might have to go through.
              A bit
              of this and a bit of that, I am quite the time killer as one imagination paces to another, I see that it’s
              noon.
              Hurray!
              It’s lunchtime (tad early today).</p>
            <p name="00f6" id="00f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Now, there’s only one objective
              to complete and the most easy and desired one.
              I check the prices and find that it was modest
              considering the quantity they had been giving to others.
              Before that, I had to check other's quota to be
              clear on how it looked and ascertain the number of chicken portions in it.
              Quite satisfied with my
              observations, I head to the food truck and ask for it.
              The server (not the internet one) took a leaf
              bowl (called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Donne</em>) and filled it with the spicy rice first.
              Then, he filled it with a few pieces of chicken, half sliced boiled egg and then some onions and lemon.
              Quite a craft.
              “He’s doing more productive work than me”, I said to myself.
              There’s only one thing left
              now and that anyone can do — binge.
              I lost sense of time as I started eating.
              It was finished in no time.
              I felt contentment and walked towards the lounge to sit for sometime, to allow myself to relax for a while
              before I could head back home.</p>
