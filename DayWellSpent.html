              reminiscing about the place my friend talked of the other day. This cafe in a tech park where one would
              relish working remotely. Most importantly, it was close to where I stay and beats the suffering from
              traffic. So, I got dressed up, packed my bag with laptop, charger, headphone, USB cable (to charge my
              phone’s battery if it dies) and a bottle of potable water. My mother was generous enough to cook me a
              delicious breakfast with Idli and Saambar (one that only mothers know how to make). After the relishing on
              this stable and filling food, I take out my car to head for this place in the hope of getting some work
              done.</p>

            <p name="5a43" id="5a43" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After a fifteen minute drive through the
              dilapidated roads and frenzy, I reach the gates to be greeted by the security guard who asked me for my ID
              card. When I showed my driving license, I realized that he was asking for something different. Lowered my
              window glass and said that I had to go to a cafe inside (recollecting from my friend’s experience). For
              which he agreed and let me pass. Parked my car in the visitor parking area and started climbing a hill to
              reach the top where the cafe was located. To give you some perspective — this cafe is located in a tech
              park which is built on an encroached lake. The lake is non-existent, however the depths of it are still
              felt. Finally, after a bit of physical exercise I reach this cafe with it’s neon lights reflecting on the
              glass panes of the building. Took a while to settle in as there were no power plug points to charge my
              laptop. After finding one, I started checking my mail as usual only to realize that the internet bandwidth
              on my phone was snail paced. I could probably go to the loo and come back by the time the webpage could
              load. All this effort in vain. Without network there was no way I could work. Saddened, I reach out of the
              building to get some fresh air only to be struck by the sight of a food truck serving Chicken Biriyani. I
              said to myself, “At least, you could eat something you liked and head back home.” I checked the time on my
              phone to realize that it was barely noon. I somehow had to stall for some time to get the next quota of
              meal that my body deserves.</p>
            <p name="beab" id="beab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, now instead of getting work done at the
              cafe, I had to pass time for the lunch. How productive of me! I started looking at people nearby walking
              from the cafeteria to their offices all dressed in a formal attire to impress their bosses and clients.
              Most of them seemed obese and in their mid twenties or thirties. Obesity is clearly an outcome of their
              sedentary lifestyle. I wondered, if I were one among them what horrors I might have to go through. A bit
              of this and a bit of that, I am quite the time killer as one imagination paces to another, I see that it’s
              noon. Hurray! It’s lunch time (tad early today).</p>
            <p name="00f6" id="00f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Now, there’s only one objective
              to complete and of course the most easy and desired one. I check the prices and find that it was modest
              considering the quantity they had been giving to others. Before that — I had to check other’s so as to be
              clear on how it looked and ascertain the number of chicken portions in it. Quite satisfied with my
              observations, I head to the food truck and ask for it. The server (not the internet one) took a leaved
              bowl (called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Donne</em>) and filled it with the spicy rice first.
              Then, he filled it with few pieces of chicken, half sliced boiled egg and then some onions and lemon.
              Quite a craft. “He’s doing more productive work than me”, I said to myself. There’s only one thing left
              now and that any one can do — binge. I lost sense of time as I started eating. It was finished in no time.
              I felt contentment and walked towards the lounge to sit for sometime, to allow myself to relax for a while
              before I could head back home.</p>
